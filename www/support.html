            I'm sure you understand that answering every non-commercial request individually neither scales nor allows me to pay any bills.
            That's why I'd like to ask you to post your non-commercial questions in a public place,
            preferrably the project's issue tracker, <a href="https://twitter.com/another_clue">Twitter</a> or IRC,
            instead of sending me an email.
            This way, more people get a chance to participate in seeing these questions and helping provide answers.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Best-effort</strong> support</li>
            <li>Absolutely <strong>free</strong></li>
            <li>Perfect for <strong>hobby projects</strong></li>
            <li>Support language is <strong>English</strong></li>

            FAQ
        </h2>

        <p>Here are some frequently asked questions.</p>

        <h3>I'm an individual and need support</h3>
        <p>
            No worries, I'm here to help. Check out the <a href="#open-source">free open-source support</a>
            section above for more details on how to best get in touch and I'll make sure to get back to you
            as soon as time permits. As a rule of thumb, the more details you provide, the better.
        </p>

        <h3>I'm an individual and want to support you</h3>
        <p>
            Thank you, much appreciated! As much as I love working with open-source,
            it can be a lot of hard work, so I appreciate your will to help.
        </p>
        <p>
            The best way to help me is by letting me know you're out there.
            Start by sending a <em>hello</em> my way and perhaps let the world know
            how you're using my open-source projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're interested in contributing to my open-source projects
            (this could include feature additions, expressing wishes, reporting bugs,
            helping with visuals or documentation and much more), make sure to let
            me know. You can always file an issue in the respective open-source project
            issue tracker or reach out to me personally.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to support me financially, that's cool – but I don't expect
            you personally to <a href="#donation">send money my way</a>.
            Instead, check if your employer is using one of my projects in a
            commercial project and if one of the above <a href="#sponsor">sponsor plans</a>
            or <a href="#consulting">custom consulting</a> makes sense for them
            to support my open-source work instead. If you're a solo developer,
            you can always start by spreading the word and letting the world know
            why you think one of my projects needs more attention ❤︎
        </p>

        <h3 id="donation">Do you accept donations?</h3>
        <p>
            Thank you for asking. At the current time, I do not want to ask individuals for a donation.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are a number of reasons for this, perhaps most importantly I think
            asking individuals for donations is a) unfair and b) <em>problematic</em>
            from a tax perspective.
            Does your project rely on one of my open-source projects for its business critical features?
            Consider signing up for a <a href="#sponsor">sponsorship</a> instead.
            If you're not making any money with my projects, I wouldn't want to
            ask you to <em>donate</em> any money.
            Instead, let's wait until your project takes off and start by spreading the word! ❤︎
        </p>

        <h3>What about invoices?</h3>
        <p>
            I'm a registered freelancer in Germany (Freiberufler) and provide
            proper invoices including VAT as applicable for all B2B contracts.
        </p>

        <h3>You're too expensive</h3>
        <p>
            <!-- if you pay peanuts, you get monkeys -->
            Bummer, but that's not a question.
            I get that there's no one-size-fits-all pricing scheme.
            This pages serves as a reference point so you can get an idea of
            how we could work together and whether it makes sense for us to
            collaborate. If you feel your work is <em>special</em> and not
            covered by the above pricing plans, you can always
            <a href="contact">reach out</a> to discuss more specific needs.
        </p>

        <h3>You're too cheap</h3>
        <p>
            Bummer. See also previous answer.
